# Smart-Gardening-System

About the Project
- [x] Smart gardening system by using Arduino Uno was successfully established and tested. 
- [x] As the smart gardening system has a user friendly design so it can be used by the household users as well as the commercial user. 
- [x] The best benefit is that it reduces the wastage of water during watering and helps in saving the precious water resource. 

Proposed System
- The proposed system is aimed to sense the moisture level from the plant at a particular instance of time, if the moisture level is less than the specified value of threshold which is predefined according to the particular plant then the desired amount of water is supplied to the plant till it’s moisture level reaches to the predefined threshold value.
- The Ultrasonic sensor is placed on the top of the storage unit which continuously keeps track of the water level in real-time, which will inform the users about the level of liquid and automatically turn on/off the water pump as per the defined functions.
